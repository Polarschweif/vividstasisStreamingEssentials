## About

`vividstasisStreamingEssentials` detects and displays your data from **vivid/stasis**,  
giving you a quick overview of your Points, Battery, Rating, and even your Soundscan Boosttickets.

It can also be used in an OBS scene by turning the background green:  
simply right-click anywhere and select **Greenscreen mode** to toggle between black and green.

- Added a message box appearing when there are news fot vividstasisStreamingEssentials
- News get written to NewsLog.txt to avoid getting the same notification more than once
- Changed the drag and drop mechanic for the profile informations to a simpler and more stable one.
   - Click a stat to select it
   - Scroll your mousewheel to move it
   - Click it again to deselect it or click a different one to change your selection
- Added a cancel button to the update message box wich leads to this website when an Update is out
  (It boots the program normally, message boxes only have ok and cancel and I am too lazy to make an extra window for it)

### 1.8.8 MASSIVE update (Release date tba, more info in the Discord server)
- overhauled the program itself by removing the title bar and added a custom one wich can be accessed by hovering over the gray trigger zone at the top. you can close and drag the wondow there.
- added social links
  - Discord 
  - This GitHub repository
- Added different modes
  - Greenscreen-Mode (I know that it has been existing since the first prototype)
  - Transparent-Mode (Turns the background transparent)
  - SemiTransparent-Mode (Turns EVERYTHING slightly transparent)
- Press F10 to enter the new code entry window. Codes soon (if there are some)
- The window cant be moved out of the screen so it cant be completely unaccessible when closed out of the screen
- Made the context menu (FINALLY) in a dark theme to not burn your eyes
- Cleaned up some unnecessary code (not really neccessary to mention here but it took me almost 2 hours)
- Fixed moving stats up or down only working while the mouse is on a stat. It works now when the mouse is somewhere on the application
  - (On tansparent background, the mouse is practically behind the window itself when it's on the transparent background. This doesnt apply to SemiTransparent-Mode)

---

## Upcoming Features
- Saving (relative) position so the window opens where it closed last time (coming in version 1.7)
- Removing the title bar (the thing that contains minimizing, closing, etc.) and still be able to move the window around (coming with version 1.7 or as an own update in 1.8)
- Having different tabs (4 in total planned), one for the quick profile overview, one for a list of the whole profile file for debug, one for every achievement and their completion and one for tamasatchi)
- thinking about a worldcross mode where the window is a bit smaller and only showing Name, Rating and Class for those who have StreamingEssentials on the right side (bc of worldcross' leaderboard thingy being also on the right side)
- having 3 slots of custom presets (basically 3 different config files) and a few pre-defined presets
